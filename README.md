Introduction:

Diabetes is a chronic disease, which is becoming common and found in every 
third person near you. According to WHO, the Centres for Disease Control and 
Prevention has indicated that as of 2018, 34.2 million Americans have diabetes 
and 88 million have prediabetes. Furthermore, the CDC estimates that 1 in 
5 diabetics, and roughly 8 in 10 prediabetics are unaware of their risk.

In this project, we want to identify important health indicators which can 
predict the person is diabetics or not. We will do the cleaning, balancing of 
the dataset and build the Machine Learning (ML )model which will be able to 
predict and do the report of the model classification and try to get most 
accuracy of the model with given datasets.
